Introduce Myself


Hi, my name is JayChen. I come from ShanTou. I graduate from Xianyang Normal University. My major is software engineering. After graduation, I found my first job in the CASCADE of PCCW. For the three years in CASCADE, I finish several J2EE and Android projects. At the beginning of the second year, I start developing an Android App called eSmartHealth. This app can display the health data of the client which collected by other wireless devices. I leave CASCADE after I finished my work contract. The second job was about developing the new function of an app called oa.cn and maintain this product. The oa.cn is design to help people make their office work efficient. My recent job was developing and maintaining two apps, soouya customer and soouya seller. They provide a place where the businessman can buy cloth or post a requirement on it. We used one project to cover these two app, each app has its own module. And they share the common network module, so the API can be reused. That's all. Thanks for your listening.
